\section*{About me}
I am a very sociable guy, easy to get along with, but more importantly can easily fit in a development team.
I have no problems dealing with high pressure situation because of my ability to manage time and tasks efficiently.
Technology has always been part of my life, I started learning coding in middle school and carried on keeping myself informed about the latest technologies.
I overall produce clean and quality code following best practices, whether it is company standards or official framework documentation.
