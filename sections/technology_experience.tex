  {Windows, Linux}
  {I have a wide knowledge of Linux distributions, starting from stable long-term support ones like Debian and Gentoo, all the way to rolling-release like Arch Linux and Ubuntu.\\
  The terminal is not something I fear. During my education I learned to configure firewalls with IP Tables and how to deploy and configure Linux servers, mostly Debian.\\
  Windows is my main operating system, which is also the one I am using currently at work, I have learned how the environment works and how to manage configurations and services.}
